	abstract = {One of the most crucial applications of radar-based precipitation nowcasting systems is the short-term forecast of extreme rainfall events such as flash floods and severe thunderstorms. While deep learning nowcasting models have recently shown to provide better overall skill than traditional echo extrapolation models, they suffer from conditional bias, sometimes reporting lower skill on extreme rain rates compared to Lagrangian persistence, due to excessive prediction smoothing. This work presents a novel method to improve deep learning prediction skills in particular for extreme rainfall regimes. The solution is based on model stacking, where a convolutional neural network is trained to combine an ensemble of deep learning models with orographic features, doubling the prediction skills with respect to the ensemble members and their average on extreme rain rates, and outperforming them on all rain regimes. The proposed architecture was applied on the recently released TAASRAD19 radar dataset: the initial ensemble was built by training four models with the same TrajGRU architecture over different rainfall thresholds on the first six years of the dataset, while the following three years of data were used for the stacked model. The stacked model can reach the same skill of Lagrangian persistence on extreme rain rates while retaining superior performance on lower rain regimes.},

              We introduce , a high-resolution radar reflectivity dataset collected by the Civil Protection weather radar of the Trentino South Tyrol Region, in the Italian Alps. The dataset includes 894,916 timesteps of precipitation from more than 9 years of data, offering a novel resource to develop and benchmark analog ensemble models and machine learning solutions for precipitation nowcasting. Data are expressed as 2D images, considering the maximum reflectivity on the vertical section at 5 min sampling rate, covering an area of 240 km of diameter at 500 m horizontal resolution. The  distribution also includes a curated set of 1,732 sequences, for a total of 362,233 radar images, labeled with precipitation type tags assigned by expert meteorologists. We validate  as a benchmark for nowcasting methods by introducing a  deep learning model to forecast reflectivity, and a procedure based on the UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm for interactive exploration. Software methods for data pre-processing, model training and inference, and a pre-trained model are publicly available on GitHub (
              https://github.com/MPBA/TAASRAD19
              ) for study replication and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {The use of analog-similar weather patterns for weather forecasting and analysis is an established method in meteorology. The most challenging aspect of using this approach in the context of operational radar applications is to be able to perform a fast and accurate search for similar spatiotemporal precipitation patterns in a large archive of historical records. In this context, sequential pairwise search is too slow and computationally expensive. Here, we propose an architecture to significantly speed up spatiotemporal analog retrieval by combining nonlinear geometric dimensionality reduction (UMAP) with the fastest known Euclidean search algorithm for time series (MASS) to find radar analogs in constant time, independently of the desired temporal length to match and the number of extracted analogs. We show that UMAP, combined with a grid search protocol over relevant hyperparameters, can find analog sequences with lower mean square error (MSE) than principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, we show that MASS is 20 times faster than brute force search on the UMAP embedding space. We test the architecture on real dataset and show that it enables precise and fast operational analog ensemble search through more than 2 years of radar archive in less than 3 seconds on a single workstation.},

	abstract = {Citizen science has shown great potential for bringing large groups of people closer to science, thanks in part to cooperation with universities and research centers. In this context, amateur weather networks played a major role in the last few decades thanks to a constant growth in technology. An example is given by the Meteonetwork association, born in 2002, and mainly composed by atmospheric science enthusiasts, who built up in time a huge weather station network in Italy. In recent years, they have enlarged their horizons over Europe, displaying real time observations and daily maps coming from both personal weather stations and ofﬁcial networks. This study described how Meteonetwork has set up an open crowdsourced weather data system, how data are validated, and which products are generated and freely accessible for scientists and stakeholders for their own purposes. Two concrete use cases were described as examples: the Weatherness Project, which selects a subnet of Meteonetwork data for biometeorological and health purposes and the data assimilation process implemented to improve the initial conditions into the WRF meteorological model for daily weather forecasts.},
